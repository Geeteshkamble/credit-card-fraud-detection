# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. By leveraging historical transaction data, the model classifies transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent using a Random Forest classifier. This README provides an overview of the project structure, dataset, installation instructions, and the approach taken to build and evaluate the model.

## Project Overview
Credit card fraud detection is a critical problem, as millions of dollars are lost annually due to fraudulent transactions. This project builds a machine learning model using the following main steps:
- Data preprocessing and handling of imbalanced data.
- Model training and tuning.
- Evaluation of model performance on unseen data.

The model is built using a **Random Forest Classifier** with hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV to achieve optimal results.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or legitimate. It includes anonymized features due to privacy concerns.

- **Number of samples**: 284,807 transactions.
- **Number of features**: 30 numeric features (anonymized), with a binary target variable (`Class`):
  - `0`: Legitimate transaction
  - `1`: Fraudulent transaction

You can download the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
   cd credit-card-fraud-detection
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   The primary libraries used are `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `imbalanced-learn`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

3. Download the dataset and place it in the project's root directory.

## Project Structure
- `credit_card_fraud_detection.py`: Main script containing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project.
- `README.md`: Project documentation (this file).

## Approach
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Missing Values**: Checked and handled any missing values.
- **Class Imbalance**: Used **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to handle class imbalance in the dataset, as fraudulent transactions are a small fraction of the dataset.
- **Feature Scaling**: Standardized the features for better performance with the Random Forest model.

### 2. Model Training
- **Classifier**: A Random Forest Classifier was selected due to its robustness and ability to handle high-dimensional data.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Used `RandomizedSearchCV` to optimize hyperparameters for the Random Forest Classifier. This includes tuning parameters like `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, and `min_samples_leaf`.

### 3. Model Evaluation
Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure it performs well across various metrics. Additionally, a confusion matrix and feature importance plot were generated to provide insights into model performance.

## Model Performance
The Random Forest Classifier achieved high performance on the test dataset with the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: 99.99%
- **Precision**: High precision for fraud detection.
- **Recall**: High recall for identifying fraud cases.
